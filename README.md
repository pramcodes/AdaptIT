# AdaptIT Hackathon Project

Welcome to the AdaptIT Hackathon project repository! This mobile app, developed in Android Studio over a 2-day hackathon, is designed to assist students in finding bursaries to support their academic endeavors.

## Description

The primary goal of this Android application is to establish a connection between students seeking financial assistance for university studies and potential bursary providers. The app is focused on enhancing accessibility to educational opportunities by facilitating the process of discovering and applying for relevant bursaries.

### Key Features
